# Temporal-Trends-in-water-quality---Georges-River-



This project was done by five Macquarie University students for Georges Riverkeep to analyse the temporal trends in water quality. 
I personally was responsible for all the coding done in R and did also contribute to the objectives and methods in the paper produced.
